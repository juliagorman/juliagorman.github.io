My passion for pedagogy started well-before graduate school. Education when performed correctly is liberating. I have experience as not only a teaching assitant but also an Associate Instructor here at UC San Diego. I have been awarded the Summer Greaduate Teaching Scholars award and fellowship for my efforts. I hope to continue to expand the courses I have taught.
