# teaching
My passion for pedagogy predates my time in graduate school, rooted in the belief that education, when approached thoughtfully, has the power to liberate and inspire. At UC San Diego, I have served as both a Teaching Assistant and an Associate Instructor, honing my teaching skills and fostering meaningful learning experiences. My dedication to education was recognized with the Summer Graduate Teaching Scholars award and fellowship, which further motivated me to expand the range of courses I teach. I look forward to continuing to develop innovative and inclusive teaching practices throughout my career
