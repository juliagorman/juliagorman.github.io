Welcome! 

I am a fifth year PhD student stuyding neural population dynamics underlying vocal communication behaviors in the Gentner Lab at UC San Diego. I am interested in sensorimotor integration, large-scale electrophyiology, dynamical systems modeling, and naturalistic behaivoral paradigms. 

 I have nearly a decade of experience creating equitable oppurtunities in STEM and scientific outreach. I worki for Colors of the Brain. I also do other things too. 

I did my Bachelors in Mathematics and Biology at Seattle University. There I swam Division 1 and also worked for Kilowatts for Kilowatts for Humanity, a chapter of Engineers Without Borders. I am from Bend, Oregon and have all the typical hobbies of someone from a small mountain town. Here in San Diego, I also do pottery, freediving, and recently got into ulra-running. 

This is a place to hold all the relevant links to my research, science communication work, and teaching/pedagogical musings.
