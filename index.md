Welcome! 

I am a fifth year PhD student stuyding neural population dynamics underlying vocal communication behaviors in the Gentner Lab at UC San Diego. My thesis works combines large-scale electrophyiology, dynamical systems modeling, and naturalistic behavioral paradigms to understand sensorimotor integration. 

I have nearly a decade of experience creating equitable oppurtunities in STEM and scientific outreach. Currently, I am a board member of UCSD Colors of the Brain which is an undergraduate mentorship program that has partnered with the Kavli Insitute for Brain and Mind to create a unique summer program aimed at recruiting historically margianlized students. I also have been invovled with STARTneuro, a NIH BP ENDURE program that gives research experience and funding to incoming transfer students as a teacing assistant and instructor. Other past work I have done can be found on my CV. 

I did my Bachelors in Mathematics and Biology at Seattle University in Washington State. I am from Bend, Oregon and have all the typical hobbies of someone from a small mountain town. Here in San Diego, I also do pottery, freediving, and can be frequently found trail running. 

This is a place to hold all the relevant links to my research, science communication work, and musings.
