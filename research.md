My research lies at the intersection of computational and systems neuroscience, with a strong foundation in neuroethology- linking naturalistic behaviors to neural signaling. Within this expansive field, I am particularly interested in sensorimotor integration and the network dynamics of neuronal populations.

As a recipient of the NIH F99/K00 Predoctoral to Postdoctoral Transition Award, I aim to leverage this funding to further my research as a postdoctoral fellow. My goal is to transition into the theoretical neuroscience space, specifically focusing on linking biophysical connectivity with emergent neural dynamics.

My research expereince spans a diverse range of disciplines, from beginning my journey doing research in Numerical Analysis to Number Theory. My formative experience as an NIH BP ENDURE fellow at Washington University in St. Louis fundamentally shaped my approach to science by giving me my first oppurtunity to work in an experimental neuroscience laboratory. It instilled in me a passion for bridging computational models with experimental work through close collaboration with experimentalists.
