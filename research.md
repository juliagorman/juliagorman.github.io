My research centers in the nebulous cloud of computational and systems neuroscience with a deep reverence for neuroethology- linking naturalistic behaviors neural signaling. Within this large span, I am interested in sensorimotor integration, specfically the network dynamics of populations of neurons. 

As a recipient of hte NIH F99/K00 award, I hope to use my funding to continue my research as a postdoctoral fellow. I want to move to the theoretical neuroscience space, specifically linking biophysical connectivity and emergent dynamics. As a recipient of the NIH F99/K00 award, I will have funding 

My research experiences have covered a wide breadth from mathematics (both Number Theory and Numerical Analysis) to experimental neuroscience. My first experiences working in a laboratory as a NIH BP ENDURE fellow at Washington University in St. Louis forever changed my perspective on how I wanted to do science; working side-by-side with experimentalists to bridge computational work with experiments. Additionally, I have a strong passion for non-mainstream model organisms. I hope to keep my list of non-rodent species I work with ongoing. See CV for more details
